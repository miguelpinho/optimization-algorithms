optimization-algorithms
=======================

Project for the Optimization and Algorithms course, on the 1st semester of 2018/19.

The project is divided into three parts:
- Part1: Optimization of a robot movement, using MATLAB CVX;
- Part2: Implementation of solvers for unconstrained optimization (Gradient, Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt);
- Part3: Formal solution for constrained optimization problems.
